# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Minax?

Minax is a full-stack AI development platform that lets you create production-ready Minecraft plugins using natural language descriptions. Instead of writing code, you describe what you want and AI generates, compiles, and deploys it.

### How much does Minax cost?

Minax offers a freemium model:

- **Free tier**: 3 credits per day
- **Premium**: Flexible pricing based on usage
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for teams

Each plugin generation typically costs 1-5 credits depending on complexity.

### Do I need to know Java?

**No!** Minax is designed for anyone. You describe your plugin in plain English or French, and the AI handles all the Java code generation. However, having Java knowledge helps you iterate faster with custom edits.

### What Minecraft versions are supported?

Minax supports:

- **1.8 to 1.21+** (all modern versions)
- **Spigot, Paper, Bukkit, and more**
- **Cross-platform** (Windows, macOS, Linux servers)

## Technical Questions

### How is my code compiled?

Minax uses **Maven** for compilation. We automatically:

1. Resolve dependencies
2. Compile your Java code
3. Detect and fix common errors
4. Generate a ready-to-deploy `.jar` file

### Can I edit the generated code?

**Absolutely!** After generation, you can:

- Edit code in the built-in Monaco editor (VS Code-like)
- Add custom logic
- Test locally
- Recompile instantly

### Where is my data stored?

Your plugins and code are stored securely in our servers. You can:

- Download `.jar` files anytime
- Export complete source code
- Delete projects whenever you want

### Is my code private?

**Yes**, by default. Your private plugins are only visible to you. You can optionally:

- Publish to the public community gallery
- Share with specific team members
- Keep everything private

## Usage Questions

### How long does generation take?

Most plugins are generated in **30-60 seconds**, including:

- AI analysis
- Code generation
- Maven compilation
- Error checking

Complex plugins may take up to 2-3 minutes.

### What types of plugins can I create?

You can create:

- ✅ Command systems
- ✅ Custom items and blocks
- ✅ Event listeners
- ✅ Database integrations
- ✅ Configuration systems
- ✅ Permission systems
- ✅ Teleportation systems
- ✅ Custom GUIs
- ✅ World generation tools

Basically anything you can describe!

### Can I use external libraries?

Yes! When describing your plugin, you can request specific libraries. Our AI will:

- Add them to your `pom.xml`
- Import necessary classes
- Integrate them into your code

### How do I deploy to my server?

Simple 3 steps:

1. **Download** your `.jar` file
2. **Copy** to `/plugins` folder
3. **Restart** your server

Your plugin is active immediately!

## Troubleshooting

### My plugin won't start

Common fixes:

1. Check server logs: `tail -f logs/latest.log`
2. Verify Java version (1.8+)
3. Check for permission errors
4. Try regenerating the plugin

### Can I use this commercially?

Yes! Generated plugins can be used:

- ✅ On public servers
- ✅ In server networks
- ✅ For client work
- ✅ For resale (check license)

Just give credit to Minax in your server motd!

### What if generation fails?

If your plugin fails to generate:

1. **Simplify** your description
2. **Break it down** into smaller features
3. **Check logs** for error details
4. **Try again** with different wording
5. **Contact support** if persistent
